# Pill Snap

## Describe your idea

Use Vision GPT to allow ER physicians and triage nurses to upload photos of loose or unknown pills. The system returns the top three likely medications with confidence scores, drastically reducing the time needed for pill identification and improving treatment speed.

## Why is it aligned to the theme: addressing burnout and improving care of healthcare professionals?

- Reduces cognitive load and manual research during high-pressure triage situations.
- Accelerates intake workflows, freeing up time for more critical clinical decisions.
- Minimizes frustration and delays, lowering stress for emergency care staff.

## Implementation Feasibility & Scalability

- Feasible using pre-trained vision models and pill databases.
- Can be rolled out via a lightweight web tool for pilot testing and later integrated into EHR systems.

## Tech Involved

- Vision GPT or other multimodal AI models
- Pill imprint and shape recognition algorithms
- Web-based frontend for image upload and result display
- Optional EHR and pharmacy system integration

## Innovation (Fresh Idea or Twist on Existing Solutions)

- Brings cutting-edge multimodal AI into ER workflows in a highly practical use case.
- Simplifies a previously slow and manual process using an intuitive, demo-ready interface.

## Supporting Evidence & Data

- Pill identification can take 30â€“90 minutes manually, especially without packaging (source: NIH).
- Delays in medication verification are linked to increased ER wait times and error rates (source: AHRQ).
- AI-powered visual recognition has shown high accuracy (>90%) in identifying common pill types (source: Nature Digital Medicine, 2022).
